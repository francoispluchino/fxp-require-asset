Getting Started
===============

## Installation

Add Fxp Require Asset in your composer.json:

```js
{
    "require": {
        "fxp/require-asset": "1.0@dev"
    }
}
```

Or tell composer to download the library by running the command:

```bash
$ php composer.phar require fxp/require-asset:1.0@dev
```

Composer will install the bundle to your project's `vendor/fxp` directory.
