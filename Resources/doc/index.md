Getting Started

## Installation

Add Fxp Require Asset in your composer.json:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "fxp/require-asset": "^1.0.0"
    }
}
```

Or tell composer to download the library by running the command:

```bash
$ php composer.phar require fxp/require-asset:"^1.0.0"
```

Composer will install the bundle to your project's `vendor/fxp` directory.
